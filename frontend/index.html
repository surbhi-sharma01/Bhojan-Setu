        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          Bhojan Setu is a platform built to bridge the gap between food donors
          and those in need. Our mission is to reduce food waste and fight
          hunger by connecting individuals, restaurants, and organizations
          willing to donate surplus food with NGOs and volunteers who can
          distribute it responsibly. We believe that no one should go to bed
          hungry when so much food goes to waste every day. Bhojan Setu makes it
          simple for anyone to make a difference — whether by donating fresh
          meals, volunteering for delivery, or supporting our cause. Through
          transparency, collaboration, and compassion, Bhojan Setu strives to
          create a community where every meal counts and no food is wasted.

        <h2>Why Donate Food — Not Waste It</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          Every grain of food holds the effort of a farmer, the energy of
          nature, and the hope of a hungry soul. Don’t let it end up in the bin
          — share it, and let it bring a smile instead.

            <h3>🌍 Save the Planet</h3>
            <p>
              When food rots in landfills, it releases methane — a gas far more
              harmful than carbon dioxide. Donating food keeps our air cleaner
              and our planet healthier.

            <h3>💖 Feed a Hungry Heart</h3>
            <p>
              Every meal you share could be the reason someone sleeps with a
              full stomach tonight. Your leftover food can become someone’s
              happiness.

            <h3>💸 Reduce Waste, Multiply Value</h3>
            <p>
              When you donate food instead of throwing it away, you give purpose
              to every rupee, every grain, and every effort that went into
              making it.

            <p>
              Bhojan Setu connects people who care — donors, NGOs, and
              volunteers — to ensure no good food goes to waste and no one goes
              hungry.
